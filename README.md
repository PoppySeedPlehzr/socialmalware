A web application for analysing malicious things, and helping said malicious things find bffs and true love <3

### Author:

Nick Anderson, but I sometimes go by Muffins because why not?  I am a dude... who likes beer and computers. I like
malware because, well, ya know, it's malware. I'm stoked about RE stuff, and I'm trying to get better at web
development, which is what this site is all about!
